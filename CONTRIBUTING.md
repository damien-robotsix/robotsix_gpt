## Code Style Guidelines

### General Coding Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style conventions.
- Where applicable, also consider [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for docstring conventions.

### Code Layout

- **Indentation:** Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Do not use tabs.
- **Line Length:** Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
- **Blank Lines:** Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines. Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single blank line.

### Imports

- Imports should always be at the top of the file, just after any module comments and docstrings.
- Follow the order: standard library imports, third-party imports, local application/library-specific imports. Each group should be separated by a blank line.
  
```python
import os
import sys

import requests

from mymodule import my_function
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Function and Variable Names:** Use lowercase words separated by underscores, e.g., `my_function`, `variable_name`.
- **Class Names:** Follow the CapWords convention, e.g., `MyClass`.
- **Constants:** Use all uppercase words separated by underscores, e.g., `MAX_OVERFLOW`.

### Comments

- Comments should be complete sentences. Use one or two spaces after a sentence-ending period.
- Ensure that comments are up to date with the code they describe.
- Use inline comments sparingly and only if necessary.

### Docstrings

- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
- Follow the conventions outlined in [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for writing docstrings.

### Strings

- Prefer using single quotes (`'`) for strings unless the string contains a single quote character.

### Whitespaces

- Avoid extraneous whitespace in the following situations:
  ```python
  # Correct:
  spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})
  
  # Wrong:
  spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )
  ```

### Exceptions

- Use specific exception types whenever possible.
- Use "try-except" block for handling exceptions when necessary. Clean up resources after exceptions using "finally".

### Best Practices

- **Type Hints:** Use type hints to specify the expected types of function arguments and return values.
- **Linter Usage:** Use tools like Flake8 or pylint to automatically check for style violations.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for new code and changes with frameworks such as pytest or unittest.

```python
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two integers and return the result."""
    return a + b
```

Please ensure you follow these guidelines when contributing new code to maintain consistency across the project. For any queries related to these guidelines, please reach out in our project's communication channel.

### Contribution Guidelines

#### Filing Issues
- **Check for Duplicate Issues:** Before creating a new issue, please search existing issues to check if the topic has already been addressed.
- **Provide Detailed Information:** When submitting an issue, include as much detail as possible. Describe the problem, how to reproduce it, and the software setup you are using.

#### Submitting Pull Requests
- **Create a Fork:** Use GitHub to fork the project, make a new branch specific to your change, and then submit a pull request.
- **Follow the Coding Standards:** Ensure that your code adheres to our coding standards listed above.
- **Include Tests:** If your contribution introduces new functionality, provide test cases to support coverage.
- **Write Clear Descriptions:** Include a comprehensive description of the changes in your pull request. Explain the problem it solves and provide additional context if needed.

#### Code Review Process
- **Be Open to Feedback:** We appreciate and review all submitted pull requests. Be open to discussions and feedback to improve the contribution.
- **Follow Up:** Address any comments or requested changes by the maintainers promptly and push follow-up commits.

#### Continuous Integration and Deployment
- Ensure your branch passes all tests and does not introduce build errors.
- Documentation updates should accompany major changes, specifying the choices and behaviors introduced in the contribution.
